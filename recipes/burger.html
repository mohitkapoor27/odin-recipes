        <h1>Lamb Merguez Sausage Patty Burger</h1>
        <img src="../images/burger.jpg">
        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Chef John transforms homemade Merguez, the spicy North African sausage, into an excellent burger! He mixes ground lamb with a quick spice blend, garlic, spicy harissa chili sauce, and tomato paste. Top of your grilled burger with feta cheese!</p>
        <p>Merguez sausage is not commonly stocked at the grocery store, so I decided to come up with an easy home version.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic (peeled)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of harissa, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground lamb</li>
            <li>1 table spoon olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine salt and fennel seeds in a mortar and pestle and pound until fine. Stir cumin, cinnamon, coriander, turmeric, and garlic cloves into the salt mixture and continue grinding to form a thick paste. Stir in harissa sauce and tomato paste until combined.</li>
            <li>Combine ground lamb and the spice paste together with a fork in a large bowl. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>Form sausage into patties. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties until no longer pink inside, 5 to 8 minutes per side, depending on the size of the patties.</li>
        </ol>
